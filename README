VYPe10 Compiler

Compiler for simple C-based programming language VYPe10. Compiler translates VYPe10 into MIPS32-Lissom assembler using tools Flex and Bison.

Whole compiler is implemented in C++.

It looks like we're going to miss deadline. So further development ends here.

Implemented features:
	* lexical analysis using Flex
	* syntactical analysis using Bison
	* semantical analysis
	* intermediate code generation
	* part of output code generation
